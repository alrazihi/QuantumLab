# Quantum Lab Roadmap — Overview
This roadmap guides development of the Quantum Lab repository: educational notebooks, reproducible scripts, notes, and result artifacts. It is organized into short-term (0–3 months), mid-term (3–12 months), and long-term (>12 months) milestones, with responsibilities, success metrics, and next steps.

<VSCode.Cell id="cell-002" language="markdown">
## Short-term (0–3 months)
- Stabilize core scripts and demos:
  - Ensure all scripts use AerSimulator and are compatible with the installed qiskit/qiskit-aer version.
  - Add simple CI checks (linting + smoke-run of unit demos).
- Complete and polish these deliverables:
  - scripts/quantum_coin_flip.py, bell_state.py, quantum_rng.py, quantum_dice.py, teleportation_demo.py, quantum_password_demo.py
  - Notebooks: 01_basics_qubits.ipynb, 02_entanglement.ipynb, 03_grovers_algorithm.ipynb (intro-level).
- Documentation & safety:
  - README.md, DISCLAIMER.txt, LICENSE.txt (royalty clause appended if desired).
  - Quick-start guide and dependency instructions.
- Success criteria:
  - All core scripts run locally on AerSimulator without ImportError on the target dev environment.
  - README and DISCLAIMER present and concise.
</VSCode.Cell>
<VSCode.Cell id="cell-003" language="markdown">
## Mid-term (3–12 months)
- Expand content and reproducibility:
  - Add more notebooks covering measurement error mitigation, noise modeling, and state tomography.
  - Add small automated examples that generate and save plots in results/plots/.
- Testing & examples:
  - Add unit tests for deterministic components where feasible.
  - Add example data files under results/data/ and scripts to reproduce them.
- Educational materials:
  - Add short, focused PDFs in notes/ for linear algebra refresher and quantum basics.
  - Add in-notebook explanations for every demo.
- Success criteria:
  - Notebooks are runnable end-to-end (via nbsphinx or papermill for CI).
  - Example plots/data produced and checked into results/.
</VSCode.Cell>
<VSCode.Cell id="cell-004" language="markdown">
## Long-term (>12 months)
- Research & experiments:
  - Add modules for variational algorithms (VQE, QAOA) with toy problems.
  - Add benchmarking against simple noise models; document findings.
- Community & collaboration:
  - Create CONTRIBUTING.md, code of conduct, and issue templates.
  - Publish demo highlights (slides or short tutorials) and consider small workshops.
- Licensing & governance:
  - Formalize licensing and royalty process (contact details, licensing terms).
- Success criteria:
  - Clear contributor flow, basic community engagement, reproducible experiments with documented results.

## Roadmap Deliverables (by component)
- notebooks/: complete, annotated notebooks with learning objectives and runnable cells.
- scripts/: clean, well-documented scripts with CLI where appropriate; consistent simulator API (AerSimulator).
- notes/: short PDF references and quick concept summaries.
- results/: reproducible plots and data; scripts to regenerate them.
- docs/: README, quick-start, LICENSE, DISCLAIMER, CONTRIBUTING, and CHANGELOG.
</VSCode.Cell>
<VSCode.Cell id="cell-006" language="markdown">
## Timeline & Milestones (example)
- Weeks 0–4: Stabilize imports, convert scripts to AerSimulator, add README and DISCLAIMER, smoke-run demos.
- Months 1–3: Complete notebooks 01–03 with explanatory text and runnable examples; generate baseline plots.
- Months 3–6: Add mid-term notebooks and reproducibility scripts; basic CI to run demos.
- Months 6–12: Expand research experiments, add tests and contributor docs.

## Responsibilities & Workflow
- Repo maintainer: overall review, license/royalty contacts, release coordination.
- Content owners: assign a person for each major area (notebooks, scripts, notes, results) to maintain quality.
- PR process: small focused PRs, include smoke-run logs for any new notebook or script.
- CI: run linting and smoke-run demos; validate imports and simulator usage.
</VSCode.Cell>
<VSCode.Cell id="cell-008" language="markdown">
## Success Metrics & Acceptance Criteria
- All core demos run without import/runtime errors on the target environment.
- Notebooks include clear learning objectives and runnable examples.
- Reproducible example outputs stored in results/ with scripts to regenerate.
- Documentation (README, DISCLAIMER, LICENSE) present and understandable.
</VSCode.Cell>
<VSCode.Cell id="cell-009" language="markdown">
## Next Steps (immediate)
1. Replace deprecated qiskit imports in all scripts with qiskit_aer.AerSimulator (verify locally).
2. Add short CI job to run a subset of scripts/notebooks once on push.
3. Populate README with quick-run commands and dependency list.
4. Assign content owners and open issues for mid-term tasks.

## Contacts & Notes
- Repository maintainer: add name/email in README for licensing/royalty discussions.
- Keep the roadmap updated as tasks complete; use Issues and Projects for tracking.
